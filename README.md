# Wakemon
A game I built in 2014 over the course of two weeks.

The  controls for it are:

	arrow up (38) = move up
	arrow down (40) = move down
	arrow left (37) = move left
	arrow right (39) = move right

	esc (27) = open/close the inventory menu
	space (32) = jump
	f (70) = drop item from inventory
	e (69) = use/action key

This has not real gameplay it's more of a rpg framework.
